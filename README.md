# Mtlx_Markdown_Test

This is a test of converting the MaterialX Specification documents into Markdown format.

We would like to test how easy it is to:

* Propose new edits to a Specification document (like Google Docs "Suggesting" mode)
* Have discussions about selected portions of a document (like Google Docs "Insert Comment" and "Reply")
* Create links from the outside into a specific part of a Specification document (requested by many but difficult to do when the Specification is released in PDF format)

In preparing this test, it became clear that using Google Docs as the primary tool to edit and maintain the Specification and then
converting and republishing to Markdown as updates are made is a non-trivial and potentially error-prone manual task.
So we would like to test if switching entirely over to publicly-viewable Markdown files in the main repository would be workable.
